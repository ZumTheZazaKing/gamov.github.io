            You take a better look at the sofa that you just sat on and it was definitely made out<br>
            of human flesh. However, there's no sign of blood or bodily fluids nor were there insides<br>
            on it. It was so clean that you start to doubt it was made out of human flesh. <br>
            <br>
            But it definitely was.
