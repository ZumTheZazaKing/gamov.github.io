            Out of curiosity, you decide to enter the house through the front door despite it being what<br>
            common folk call 'rude'.<br>
            <br>
            After letting yourself in, you close the door behind you and you find yourself standing in<br>
            what appears to be a living room. The room seems to be tidy and organised which must mean<br>
            that someone's living here.<br>
            <br>
            "Hello! Is anyone here?", you call out as you gradually walk up to a big and fluffy sofa.<br>
            You don't get any response from your call and the sofa in front of you suddenly seems appealing.<br>
            Looking back, you've been walking for a pretty long time. You decide to take a break and sit<br>
            down on the sofa.<br>
            <br>
            As you do so, something feels off. You put your hand on the sofa and you realize that the sofa<br>
            wasn't made by your everyday material. You quickly stand back up and behold, the sofa was made<br>
            out of flesh. What's more terrifying about it is that the flesh was that of humans.<br>
            <br>
            Things got from 0 to 100 real quick.
