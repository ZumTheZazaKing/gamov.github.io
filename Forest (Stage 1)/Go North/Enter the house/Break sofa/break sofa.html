            Probably due to curiosity, you attempt to break the sofa by kicking it constantly and rapidly.<br>
            After some time, you dealt some damage to the sofa to the extent you made it bleed.<br>
            <br>
            "Hey! No vandalism in this house!" a feminine voice echoes throughout the room.<br>
            <br>
            "Who's there? Show yourself!", you utter as you try to grasp a better understanding of the situation.<br>
            <br>
            "Sure. We can meet face to face, IF you can get out of The Living Room"<br>
            <br>
            "The Living Room?"<br>
            <br>
            "You never heard of it? For an AAA agent, you're pretty ill-informed. The Living Room is just a<br>
            living room that'll slowly turn anyone that's inside of it into a piece of flesh furniture"<br>
            <br>
            "Are you serious?!", you exclaim as you realize that every piece of flesh furniture used to be<br>
            a living, breathing human being.<br>
            <br>
            "Of course! Anyway, back to the topic, we can meet if you can get out of it. How exactly? That's<br>
            easy! All you have to do is answer all of my questions correctly and I'll let you out. That's a<br>
            promise. However, if you answer incorrectly, I'll speed up the turning process by 1000%! So, what<br>
            do you say?"
