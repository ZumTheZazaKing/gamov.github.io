            Despite it having the possibility of being a bad idea, without a second thought, you reach out your hands<br>
            towards the fireballs as an attempt to catch them. Miraculously, you managed to catch all of them and with one<br>
            casual blow, you create a breeze which put out the fireballs in your hand.<br>
            <br>
            "Are you seriously trying to burn down your house?", you chatise.<br>
