            Quicker than a heartbeat, you swiftly evade the projectile and instead of you, the bolt strikes a wooden<br>
            wall of the houe but it didn't set on fire.<br>
            <br>
            "You actually managed to dodge that? How impressive", the voice proclaims from behind. You turn around<br>
            and you see a girl with pure white skin wearing a black dress and what appears to be a witch hat on top<br>
            of her head. The girl seems to be holding a strange looking stick in one of her hands.<br>
            <br>
            "Are you the owner of this house?", you ask.<br>
            <br>
            "Apparently so. Unfortunately, I'll have to kill you now Mr. Agent" the girl answers as she points her<br>
            stick at you. The girl's stick then begins to glow and at this point you realize that the stick just<br>
            might be a wand.<br>
            <br>
            "Wait! We can talk this out"<br>
            <br>
            "That's what the others said when they tried to deceive me!" the girl exclaims as she shoots out three<br>
            flaming fireballs at you with her wand.
