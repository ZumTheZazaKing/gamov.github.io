            Thinking it'd be a good idea, you decide to take a bite from one of the flesh walls of The Living Room.<br>
            <br>
            "Tastes like pork", you thought as you take even more bites after you finished swallowing the first one.<br>
            <br>
            "Are you even human?! Why would you do that?!" the voice shrieks.<br>
            <br>
            You're completely oblivious to the voice's words as you continue to devour the layers of the flesh wall.<br>
            It didn't take long for you to get out of The Living Room through a hole you accidentally made and you <br>
            only realize it after consuming your last bite.<br>
            <br>
            "Ah, that was delish. Huh? I'm out already? Welp, that's that. Now then, come out and show yourself", you<br>
            request as you lick your fingers.<br>
            <br>
            "Ugh! Fine, you mosnter! Just stay there and don't do anything else crazy", the voice notifies as you hear<br>
            footsteps coming your way.<br>
            <br>
            While waiting for the entity who owns those footsteps to appear, you turn around and you're shocked to see<br>
            that The Living Room is no longer there and instead it was replaced by a normal living room. For some reason,<br>
            you feel really angry and you crave for the taste of human flesh.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, a bolt of lightning catches your attention as it's heading straight towards you.
