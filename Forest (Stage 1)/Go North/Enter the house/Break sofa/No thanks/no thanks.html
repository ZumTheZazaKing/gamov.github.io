            "No thanks", you decline boldly.<br>
            <br>
            "Oh, you want to get out of it by yourself? I like your type but I don't really think there's a possible way<br>
            to get out without my help. Are you sure you want to refuse the offer?" the voice similar to that of a girl's<br>
            questions.<br>
            <br>
            "Yeah, I can do this myself", you assure.<br>
            <br>
            "Okay then. I'll just be watching you die a slow death. This should be entertaining", the voice chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            You decide to refuse the voice's offer as you are confident with your survival skills. You brainstorm about<br>
            the possible ways you can break free from this fleshy cage. However, you can't stay here for too long or <br>
            you'll end up becoming furniture of rather low quality.<br>
