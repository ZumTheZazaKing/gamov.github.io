            "You'll actually do it? That's great! I'll fill you in with the rules. There'll be <strong>five questions</strong> in total and<br>
            I'll give you <strong>ten seconds</strong> to answer each of them. If you <strong>answer all of them correctly</strong>, I'll let<br>
            you out of The Living Room, I don't break my promises. However, if you <strong>answer one of the questions <br>
            incorrectly,</strong> I'll have you turned into flesh furniture immediately. That goes the same for if you're <strong><br>
            too slow to answer</strong>. Sounds good?", the voice explains.<br>
