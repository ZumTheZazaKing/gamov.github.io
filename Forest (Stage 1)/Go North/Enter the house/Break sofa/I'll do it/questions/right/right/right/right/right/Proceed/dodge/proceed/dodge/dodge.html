            Without a moment to waste, you swiftly dodge the ice shard and it flies pass through where your body was.<br>
            <br>
            "There! Done! I dodged it! Now let's talk", you request.<br>
            <br>
            "Ugh! Fine! You're lucky I keep my promises. But if you try to hurt me, I'll break it!", the girl proclaims<br>
            as she menancingly points her wand at you.<br>
            <br>
            "Hurt you? I don't have anything on me that can hurt you"<br>
            <br>
            "Oh yeah? Then strip for me. Who knows what you're hiding underneath those clothes", the girl dares.<br>
            <br>
            "Fine then! I'll strip!", you scoff as you instantly take off all of your clothing from head to toe.<br>
            <br>
            "Eeeek! I didn't actually mean it! How could you do something so indecent in front of a young maiden<br>
            like me?!", the girl shrieks as she cover her eyes with her hands.<br>
            <br>
            "Sorry, I'll put everything back on. I acidentally did it in the heat of the moment", you apologise<br>
            as you quickly put on your clothing.<br>
            <br>
            "Okay, I see. Ahem. Anyway, it seems that you really don't pose any threat. I'm sorry for doubting<br>
            you earlier. Let's start over, shall we? My name is Nimu! What's your name?"<br>
            <br>
            "My name? My name is..."
