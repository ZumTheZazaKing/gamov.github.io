            "Oh my! Congratulations! You actually managed to answer all of the questions correctly!<br>
            I wasn't expecting that. So tell me, how were they? Pretty good, right?"<br>
            <br>
            "Most of those five questions made no sense", you respond with fed up expression.<br>
            <br>
            "Hey! Don't talk dirty about them. Anyway, a promise is a promise. I'll let you out<br>
            now", the voice declares as The Living Room you're standing in somehow disappears into<br>
            thin air and it was completely replaced with an ordinary living room.<br>
            <br>
            "Thanks. Now then, come show yourself. You said you would if I got out", you remind.<br>
            <br>
            "I did say that, didn't I? Oh well. Stay right there, I'm coming", the voice replies<br>
            as you suddenly hear footsteps coming your way.<br>
            <br>
            As you were about to doze off for just a moment, a speeding lightning bolt catches<br>
            your eyes as it heads towards you with incredible speed.
