            Without a second thought, you swiftly evade the bolt of lightning and it passes right through where<br>
            your head was. Instead of you, it strikes the wooden wall behind you however, combustion did not happen.<br>
            <br>
            "My, my, you actually managed to dodge that? That's quite impressive" the voice utters from behind.<br>
            <br>
            You quickly turn around and you see a girl with pure white skin wearing a black dress and what appears<br>
            to be a witch hat on top of her head. With one of her hands, the girl is holding a weird looking stick<br>
            that might just be her wand due to her appearance.<br>
            <br>
            "Hey! Can't we just talk this out?", you ask.<br>
            <br>
            "Sure, if you can dodge this!", the girl exclaims as she shoots out an incredibly sharp ice shard from her<br>
            stick at you.<br>
            <br>
            At this point, you're certain that the stick is definitely a wand.
