            You decide to walk around the house instead of letting yourself in because that would<br>
            be rude, wouldn't it?<br>
            <br>
            You casually saunter to one side of the house and eventually you reach what seems to be<br>
            the house's backyard. There, you see many unwanted things you would never want your eyes<br>
            to devour. Corpses and carcasses were gathered in one pile like a haystack and blood<br>
            leaked out from that pile and was absorbed by the soil beneath it.<br>
            <br>
            'Who could be behind such monstrosity?', you wonder as several items lying on the ground<br>
            catches the attention of your eyes.
