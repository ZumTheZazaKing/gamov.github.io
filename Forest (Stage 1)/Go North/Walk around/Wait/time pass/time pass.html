            "My, my, what do I have here?", a feminine voice sounded from behind.<br>
            <br>
            You turn around and you see a girl with pure white skin wearing <br>
            a long black dress and what appears to be a hat similar to that of a witch's on top of<br>
            her head.<br>
            <br>
            "I expected you to enter my house through the front door. Oh well, I guess I'll have<br>
            to kill you here Mr. Agent", the girl sighs as she equips what appears to be a stick<br>
            in her hand.<br>
            <br>
            "Agent? I think you have the wrong idea, miss", you respond as you stand up straight.<br>
            <br>
            "You can't trick me, AAA!", the girl refutes as she somehow shot out a lightning<br>
            bolt at you from that stick of hers.<br>
            <br>
            Things just got from 0 to 100 real quick.
