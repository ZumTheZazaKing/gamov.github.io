            After you intorduced yourself to Nimu, you get off her and she introduces herself<br>
            afterwards. Once the misunderstandings were resolved and each side had forgiven<br>
            each other, you decide to live with Nimu in her house as you have no where else<br>
            to live. A couple of days later, Nimu suggests you continue your journey to the<br>
            North and you absolutely agree with the idea. You, along with Nimu because she wanted<br>
            to, departs from the house and a few hours later, the two of you found a road. Both<br>
            of you follow the road and it seems that it led you two to what seems to be an isolate<br>
            town. You enter the town with Nimu by your side.<br>
            <br>
            What awaits you and Nimu in the small town? Find out in Stage 2!
