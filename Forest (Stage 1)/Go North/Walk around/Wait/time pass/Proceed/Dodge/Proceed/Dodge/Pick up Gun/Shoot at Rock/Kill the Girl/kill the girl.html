            She mistaken you as someone else, tried to kill you two times and now she pleads for<br>
            your mercy. 'She really is one of the lowest of the low', you thought to yourself.<br>
            <br>
            Without even blinking, you pull the trigger and...<br>
            <br>
            <em>BANG!</em><br>
            <br>
            Headshot. The girl falls down to the ground and blood pours out from her broken head.<br>
            Did you know what you have just done? That's right. You had just taken a life.<br>
            For some reason, you feel good about it without a hint of remorse.<br>
            <br>
            'It feels so satisfying to kill someone', you thought as you stare at the girl's<br>
            body which was now nothing but a rotten corpse.<br>
            <br>
            That girl must have been a witch and that stick of hers must have been her wand.<br>
            Even so, you still managed to kill her. Without wasting anymore of your precious time,<br>
            you continue your journey to the North.
