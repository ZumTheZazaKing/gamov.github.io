            Without a moment to waste, you swiftly jump out of the plasma ball's path and instead of<br>
            you, it completely obliterates the trees that were behind you.<br>

            "You can dodge that as well? You're better than I thought" the girl chirped as she throws<br>
            a nonchalant smile at you.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
