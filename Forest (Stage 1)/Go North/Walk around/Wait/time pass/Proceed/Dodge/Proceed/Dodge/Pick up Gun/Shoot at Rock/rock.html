            You aim your gun at the girl, you pull the trigger and you completely miss her.<br>
            <br>
            "Hah! Watch where you're aiming, buddy!", the girl laughs.<br>
            <br>
            "I wasn't aiming for you" you reply.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, the girl was shot in the back by the same bullet you launched earlier. It seems that you <br>
            deliberately missed her so she could have her guard down and then the bullet ricocheted off a rock <br>
            which would then get to her back.<br>
            <br>
            "I-I see...", the girl muttered as she drops to her knees and drool out blood.<br>
            <br>
            You gradually approach her with your gun pointed at her head in case she tries to do anything<br>
            sneaky.<br>
            <br>
            "P-Please don't kill me..." the girl sniffled as a single tear dropped to the ground.
