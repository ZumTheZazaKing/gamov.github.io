            In an instant, you leap towards a gun on the ground and you pick it up. With the gun,<br>
            you aim it at the girl as a threat for her to back down.<br>
            <br>
            "My, my, you're finally using a weapon? Just so you know, guns won't work on me",<br>
            the girl proclaims with smirk.<br>
            <br>
            'Guns won't work on her? That must mean she's able to deflect the shots using some sort<br>
            of damn magic', you thought.<br>
