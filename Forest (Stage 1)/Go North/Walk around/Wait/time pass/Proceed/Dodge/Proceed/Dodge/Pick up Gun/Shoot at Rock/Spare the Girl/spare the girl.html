            "Don't worry, I won't kill you. I don't have a reason to. What I just did was merely<br>
            self-defense", you assure as you throw away your gun from your hands and crouch down<br>
            to be on the same eye level as the girl.<br>
            <br>
            "But aren't you with the AAA?", the girl asks as she looks up at you.<br>
            <br>
            "I already told you, miss. You got the wrong person", you giggled as you gave the girl<br>
            a nonchalant smile.<br>
            <br>
            "Oh, I see. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you earlier. I should've known you weren't one<br>
            of them. You don't even wear their unifroms and have their weapons"<br>
            <br>
            "Hey. You have a lot of explaining to do. I want to know more about you. First of all,<br>
            what's your name?", you question as you stand back up and extend a hand towards the girl.<br>
            <br>
            "My name? My name is Nimu"<br>
            <br>
            "Nimu? I like that name. It's nice"<br>
            <br>
            "What's your name, mister?"<br>
            <br>
