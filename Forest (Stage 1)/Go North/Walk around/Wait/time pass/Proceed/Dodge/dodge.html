        Without hesitation, you swiftly dodge the girl's lightning bolt at the last second. Instead of you, the<br>
        lightning bolt strikes a tree and it creates a large fire within mere seconds.<br>
        <br>
        "Impressive. Nobody has ever managed to dodge my attacks. However, can you dodge this?", the girl<br>
        smirks as she points her stick up into the air.<br>
        <br>
        Out of the blue, the wind around you starts howling as it seems that the air around you is <br>
        being gathered at one place which was above the girl's stick. All of the air that the girl <br>
        was gathering didn't take long for it turn into what appears to be a huge ball of plasma.<br>
        <br>
        "If you're wondering how I could make plasma with air, the explanation is fairly simple.<br>
        Technically, you can't compress gas into plasma. You need to excite the gas atoms first<br>
        so that they can ionize into ions and electrons. Then, you get plasma", the girl explains<br>
        with a smug look on her face.<br>
        <br>
        "Umm..."<br>
        <br>
        "Ugh! You're too dumb to understand. Take this!" the girl chided as she threw the ball of<br>
        plasma at you.
