            sit up and you look around at your surroundings. It appears that you are in what <br>
            seems to be an abandoned mine. You got here through the hole you fell down earlier.<br>
            You soon realize that you're sitting down on a hill of dirt which is being carried<br>
            by a single minecart. You're still alive because of that. You stand and jump of the pile dirt<br>
            and you brush of the brownish black material that sticks to your ragged clothes.<br>
