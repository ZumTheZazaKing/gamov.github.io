            You go up to the crate and you take of its lid which conceals the contents of it.<br>
            Inside the crate lied hundreds of sticks of dynamite which had the infamous color:<br>
            red<br>
            Seeing the buttload amount of crimson sticks gives you the idea to use all of them<br>
            for no absolute reason. <br>
            'How should I ignite them?', you wonder. Your question was answered shortly afterwards<br>
            when you find a small remote control with a single red button on it in the crate. <br>
            The button had a word on it which clearly spell out:'<strong>DETONATE</strong>'.<br>
            <br>
            'Great', you thought as all that is left to do is think of a place to detonate your<br>
            bombs.
