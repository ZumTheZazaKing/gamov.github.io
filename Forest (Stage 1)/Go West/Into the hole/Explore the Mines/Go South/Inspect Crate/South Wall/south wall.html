            You plant all of the crate's dynamite at the south wall of the current room and<br> 
            you hide behind the wheel loader as you ready your thumb to hit the button.<br>
            Without wasting anymore time, you detonate the dynamite and the south wall collapses.<br>
            <br>
            Well...that was exhilarating.<br>
            <br>
            You come out from behind the wheel loader and you realize that there was a room<br>
            brightened up by anonymous blue light beyond the mine wall that you just blew up.<br>
            'It must have been hidden', you thought.<br>
            <br>
            Due to curiosity, you enter the room and you stumble across a strange black spherical<br>
            item that's burrowed into a side of the room's walls.<br>
            <br>
            Unexpectedly, you hear footsteps approaching.
