            You continue to observe the man and his actions. The man goes up to the black item<br>
            that's been burrowed into the wall and he reaches out his hand towards it. Just as it<br>
            seemed that he was about to grab it, the mysterious item suddenly disappears into<br>
            thin air.<br>
            <br>
            You don't understand what just happened and it appears that goes for the man as well.<br>
            <br>
            "Gah!", the man shouted out angrily as he started randomly firing shots around the room like a<br>
            madman.<br>
            <br>
            Apparently, one of his shots ricochet off a nearby wall and it went straight for your<br>
            head...
