            Swiftly, you hide behind a large stalactite and you wait for the person who<br>
            owns the footsteps you just heard to enter the room. It didn't take long for the person<br>
            to reveal themselves as a man carrying what seems to be a rifle entered the room through<br>
            another entrance you suppose.<br>
            <br>
            You observe what the man is doing and it seems that the unknown entity is nearing the<br>
            black spherical item on the wall.
