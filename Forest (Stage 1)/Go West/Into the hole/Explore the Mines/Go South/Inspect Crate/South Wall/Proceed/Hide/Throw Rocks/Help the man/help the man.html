            You decide to aid the man in battle since you feel as if he has already gone through<br>
            enough. Carrying the rocks in your hand, you throw a bombardment of the solid <br>
            minerals to the bear with full force. Did it deal damage? Only a bit. By the way, since<br>
            the rocks spread out when you threw them, most of them actually hit the man.<br>
            <br>
