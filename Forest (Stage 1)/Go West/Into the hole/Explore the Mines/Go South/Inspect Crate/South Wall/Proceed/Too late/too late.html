            You were too slow. The person who owned those footsteps had already entered<br>
            the room through a different entrance. It's a man carrying what appears to be<br>
            a rifle. Of course, the man spots you almost immediately as you idle around<br>
            in the same spot.<br>
            <br>
            "<strong>What are you doing here, kid?</strong>", the man questions with an insincere smile.<br>
            <br>
            The man seems dangerous. You better not upset him.
