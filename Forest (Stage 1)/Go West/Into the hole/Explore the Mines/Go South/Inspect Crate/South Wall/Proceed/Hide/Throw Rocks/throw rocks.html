            You pick up all of the nearest rocks that you could find on the ground and<br>
            you gather them in the palm of your left hand. Afterwards, you quickly <br>
            think of a plan in your head.
            <br>
            After you strategize your plan, you execute it.<br>
            <br>
            You throw a rock nearby the man. The man definitely heard the rock landing<br>
            and he turns around to look at it. While the man was distracted, you go out<br>
            of your stalactite and you swiftly hide behind another one. Then, you repeat<br>
            the process until you run out of rocks.<br>
            <br>
            It seems that you achieved what you initially aimed for. Your plan was to distance<br>
            the man from the black item and for you to get closer to it. You are currently<br>
            closer to the item than the man who is standing near the entrance he came through.
            <br>
            Now, you can get the item first. However...<br>
            <br>
            "I thought I already killed you!", the man proclaims as what seems to be a bear<br>
            emerges from the shadows and attacks the man head-on.
