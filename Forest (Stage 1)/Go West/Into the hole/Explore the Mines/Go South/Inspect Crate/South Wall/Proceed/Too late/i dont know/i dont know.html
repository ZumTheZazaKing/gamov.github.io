            "I honestly don't know", you answer with a timid expression.<br>

            "You don't know? If it's like that then, tell me. Who are you?", the man asks<br>
            as he gradually approaches.<br>
            <br>
            "Why must you ask?"

            "You're the one who caused that explosion, right? There's no one else here<br>
            so it's obvious. That's why I want to know who you are", the man responds as he<br>
            stands an arm away from you.<br>
            <br>
            "Umm..."<br>
            <br>
            "Anyways, back to the original question, <strong>who are you?</strong>"<br>
            <br>
            This is bad. This creep wants to know who you are and you haven't communicated<br>
            with others for so long that you currently have social anxiety.
