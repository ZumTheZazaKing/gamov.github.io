            You plant all of the crate's dynamite at the east wall of the current room and<br> 
            you hide behind the wheel loader as you ready your thumb to hit the button.<br>
            Without wasting anymore time, you detonate the dynamite and the east wall collapses.<br>
            As soon as that happened, molten lava pours into the room.<br>
            <br>
            Seems like you blasted a hole in a lava pit. That's a bad thing. As if things <br>
            couldn't get any worse, it did. The ceiling of the room breaks apart and you<br>
            look up to see molten red lava rapidly flowing into the room...
