            You skillfully climb onto the wheel loader and you sit at its driver's seat. You think that<br>
            you can use the wheel loader to your advantage to escape the terrible place that you are at.<br>
            However, you soon realize that the heavy-duty machine requires a key to actually function.<br>
            'What a bummer...', you thought as you climb back down.
