            You look around your area and you become nauseated by the site around you. Blood was<br>
            everywhere, corpses were piled up on top of each other like trash and the strong smell<br>
            of fresh iron didn't help soothe your mind one bit. Among all of the mess, you stand in<br>
            the center of it.<br>
            <br>
            The mines' walls were covered with hundreds of different messages that were all written<br>
            with blood that had already dried up. "HELP", "SAVE US", "IT'S HERE", <br>
            "THERE'S NO ESCAPE". Those were a few of what the messages said.<br>
            <br>
            You have a really bad feeling about this. You know that the entity who is watching you<br>
            is the one behind all of this.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>It might react if you make a move for your life.</strong>
