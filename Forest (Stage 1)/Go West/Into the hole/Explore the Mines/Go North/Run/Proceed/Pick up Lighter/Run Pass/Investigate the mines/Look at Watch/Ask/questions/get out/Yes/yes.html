            "Yes", you respond politely.<br>
            <br>
            "Very well. If it's like that then, we shall escort you to the hole and help you get out of here<br>
            through there. Oh, by the way, I'm truly sorry if the other three tried to attack you. They can<br>
            always be like that to outsiders. But I assure you that they won't attack you anymore. So please,<br>
            put away the lighter"<br>
            <br>
            "Oh, okay," you reply as you extinguish your lighter's flame.<br>
            <br>
            The Black Damp was right. The Fire Damp, Stink Damp and White Damp were no longer hostile towards you.<br>
            After the disappearance of your ball of light, you and the Four Damps traveled to where you were from<br>
            the start of your exploration, that damn hole.<br>
            <br>
            After some time, you and the Four Damps finally arrive at your start point.<br>
            <br>
            "Here it is. Now all that you have to do is climb out"<br>
            <br>
            "But I can't. It's way to hard for a regular human to climb out", you complain.<br>
            <br>
            "If that's the case, you shall do so with our help", the black smoke notify as you suddenly feel yourself<br>
            being lifted. You look down and you see that the Fire Damp was carrying you. Soon after that, <br>
            the Stink Damp, the White Damp and the Black Damp joined in with the Fire Damp and together, <br>
            the Four Damps instantaneously launched you up the dark hole.
