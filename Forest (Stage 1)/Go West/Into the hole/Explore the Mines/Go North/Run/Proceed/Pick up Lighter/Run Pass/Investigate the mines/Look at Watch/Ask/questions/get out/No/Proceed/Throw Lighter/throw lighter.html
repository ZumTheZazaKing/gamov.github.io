            Without wasting anymore time, you throw your ignited lighter at the red smoke with one mighty<br>
            lunge. The red smoke didn't have a single moment to respond and when it came in contact with<br>
            the lighter's flame, it abruptly explodes violently.<br>
            <br>
            The explosion was tremendous and it manages to reach the white smoke and green smoke and when<br>
            it did, they exploded as well. The three explosions were capable enough of bringing the entirety<br>
            of the mines' ceiling to collapse.<br>
            <br>
            You don't know what to think of when you saw the dirt above you suddenly falling, so all<br>
            that you could do was brace yourself...
