            "No", you respond with a face befitting for a liar.<br>
            <br>
            "Is that so? If that's the case, how did you get here?", the Black Damp questions.<br>
            <br>
            "That's the thing, I didn't. I was originally from here", you answer with a smirk<br>
            on your face.<br>
            <br>
            "You mean...you were a miner here?!"<br>
            <br>
            "Yes, I was a miner here and I will avenge my brethen who were all killed by you<br>
            four", you proclaim without thinking much of your survivability.<br>
            <br>
            "I should've known! Gah! Oh well. This is the end for you. The other three may<br>
            be scared of your lighter but I am not. You are surrounded by us and you have no<br>
            where else to go. Accept your fate, pesky human", the Black Damp chided as it<br>
            charges at you with full speed.<br>
            <br>
            Oh boy. What have you got yourself into?
