            You raise your hand holding your ignited lighter high up in the air and you bring it forth<br>
            towards the red and green smoke. Both of them instantaneously back away and they both<br>
            make the same noise the white smoke did at first. Seems like the red and green smoke are<br>
            also afraid of fire, just like the white smoke.<br>
            <br>
            No wonder they're not attacking you.
