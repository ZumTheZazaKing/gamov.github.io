            You pick up an old page of a newspaper that seems to be torn out. Despite it being scruffy<br>
            and covered with dirt, you still manage to make out what's on it. This is what it says:<br>
            <br>
            <iframe src="the newspaper.html" 
            title="The Newspaper"
            width="800px"
            height="500px"
            style="border:none"></iframe>
