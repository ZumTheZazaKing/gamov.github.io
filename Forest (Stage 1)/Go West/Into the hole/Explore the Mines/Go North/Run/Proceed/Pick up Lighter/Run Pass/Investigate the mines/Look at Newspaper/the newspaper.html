    <h1>"There must be something in the Air"</h1>
    It goes without saying that we need air to live and breathe.<br>
    <br>
    The air we breathe on the surface is a mixture of several gases including oxygen, nitrogen,<br>
    argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases in trace amounts.<br>
    <br>
    We breathe easiest with 21% oxygen present in the air.<br>
    <br>
    When other gases contaminant the air, the oxygen levels drop, and that is when the <br>
    trouble begins.<br>
    <br>
    The air in mines can be contaminated by the presence of other gases such as carbon monoxide,<br>
    hydrogen sulfide, methane, and excess of carbon dioxide.<br>
    <br>
    Due to being in a confined space these gases are not always able to disperse and can therefore<br>
    build up in the mine, and due to their combustible, explosive, or toxic qualities this is a<br>
    serious issue.<br>
    <br>
    These other gases are often referred to as mine damps. This name comes from the German word<br>
    Dampf meaning “vapour”.<br>
    <br>
    Rather than one particular gas they are a toxic or explosive mixture of different gases<br>
    that have a varying effect on human health and mine safety.<br>
    <br>
    These damps are produced or released during mining operations including drilling and<br>
    blasting, by mining machinery such as diesel and gasoline motors, and by other means<br>
    such as the decay of timbers, the aftereffects of mine fires, and chemical processes<br>
    like oxidation.<br>
    <br>
    A dangerous mine atmosphere is one that is toxic or explosive and there are several damps<br>
    that create this kind of atmosphere. They are:<br>
    <h3>White Damp</h3>
    <h3>Black Damp</h3>
    <h3>Stink Damp</h3>
    <h3>Fire Damp</h3>
