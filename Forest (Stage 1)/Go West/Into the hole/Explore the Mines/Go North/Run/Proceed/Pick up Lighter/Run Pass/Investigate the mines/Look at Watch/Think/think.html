            Right after the alarm from the digital watch went off, two new sentient smoke appeared<br>
            and instead of white, they're green and red. The new challengers seem to share the same<br>
            sense of fear as the white smoke. You don't really know for sure so you should try<br>
            clearly <strong> showing them your lighter </strong>.<br>
            <br>
            You should also check if the two newcomers can speak human language. You can probably do<br>
            so by simply <strong>asking</strong>. If they respond, then you can get them to explain<br>
            what happened in these mines. If they don't, oh well...<br>
            <br>
            That's all that you can think of.
