            Without further delay, you leap towards a grey lighter on the ground and you use it<br>
            to make a fire that could be called the world's smallest. You are confident that the<br>
            tiny blaze that you have made using the process of combustion could defend you against<br>
            the white smoke so you hold it up high with all your might.<br>
            <br>
            It didn't take long for the white smoke to come around the corner and once it did, <br>
            it charges at you with full speed. However, once the somewhat sentient white smoke<br>
            notices your small flame, it leapt away instantaneously as if it was truly scared of it.<br>
            Shortly afterwards, the smoke somehow hisses, a sign of disapproval.<br>
            <br>
            How interesting. The white smoke is scared of fire. You can use its weakness to<br>
            your advantage.
