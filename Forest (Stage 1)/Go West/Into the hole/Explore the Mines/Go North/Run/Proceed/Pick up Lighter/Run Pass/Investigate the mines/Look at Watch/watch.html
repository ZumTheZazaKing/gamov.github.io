            You pick up a digital wrist watch from the ground and you notice that the<br>
            time it displays is a quarter past one in the evening. It must have stopped working<br>
            at that time you assume but its not really that important.<br>
            <br>
            As you drop it back down to the ground, out of the blue, it starts to emit a loud<br>
            irritating noise. It must have been the alarm of the watch, but you wonder why it's<br>
            still working.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, the ground beneath you starts to shake violently and you refuse to let yourself<br>
            get thrown off-balance. The shaking stops after a few seconds but the aftermath of the <br>
            sudden earthquake was unexpected.<br>
            <br>
            It took less than a few seconds for a green smoke similar to the white smoke to appear from<br>
            the mines' ceiling and red smoke which was also similar to the white smoke to appear from <br>
            the mines' floor. Both the green smoke and red smoke appear sentient as they somehow expressed<br>
            caution towards your ignited lighter.
