            You go up to the rotten corpse that lies peacefully on the ground. There's nothing really<br>
            interesting about it. However, in one of it's hands was a knife covered in crimson blood.<br>
            <br>
            'What in the world happened?', you wonder as you realize that the corpse's neck was cut.
