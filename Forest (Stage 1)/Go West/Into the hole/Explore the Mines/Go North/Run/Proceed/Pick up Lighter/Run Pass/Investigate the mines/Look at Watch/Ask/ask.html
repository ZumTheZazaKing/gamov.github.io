            "Do any of you guys understand me?", you ask with the hopes of having at least one of them<br>
            capable of understanding human language.<br>
            <br>
            After a few seconds of awkward silence, the red and green smoke finally responded by shaking<br>
            their heads. How did you know that they did so despite them not having heads? It was just a hunch.<br>
            <br>
            However, it didn't take long for you to get a actual response.<br>
            <br>
            "I can understand you very clearly, human", a voice resonated from behind.<br>
            <br>
            You turn around and you see that black smoke had instantly arisen from the ground. White, green, red<br>
            and now black. The black smoke formed right in front of you and it showed no signs of fear or<br>
            caution of your ignited lighter.<br>
            <br>
            "Who are you? <strong>What do you want?</strong>", the black smoke questions as he appears to be the leader of all<br>
            of the smoke that has appeared before you.
