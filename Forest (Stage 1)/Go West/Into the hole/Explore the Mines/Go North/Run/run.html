            Knowing that someone or something within the shadows might attack you at<br>
            any moment, you make a run for it.<br>
            <br>
            As you sprint down through the hollow tunnels of the mines, you look back<br>
            and you see thick white smoke chasing after you like a homing missile.<br>
            The smoke was catching up to you in no time and you know that you won't<br>
            be able to outrun it.<br>
            <br>
            After sometime, you make a turn and what awaits you after that turn is<br>
            very unfortunate for you. It's a dead end. Not knowing what to do, you panic<br>
            as you look around the area for anything that could do you good.<br>
            <br>
            Fortunately, there are a few items probably left behind by the dead<br>
            miners that might be able to assist you.<br>
            <br>
            You have to choose quickly, danger is imminent.
