            You decide to go North because...why not? As you wander around in the north side<br>
            of the abadoned mines, you discover something...utterly disturbing.<br>
            <br>
            It was a human corpse and a carcass of what appears to be a yellow canary.<br>
            <br>
            'The dead bird makes sense but why was someone abadoned here to rot?', you<br>
            thought as you take a look at the corpse which seems to belong to a miner of<br>
            these mines.<br>
            <br>
            Despite being spooked by the sudden display, you continue your journey into<br>
            the mines.<br>
            <br>
            After several minutes of venturing, you stop as you suddenly feel that someone<br>
            is watching you from the shadows. What a sudden turn of events.
