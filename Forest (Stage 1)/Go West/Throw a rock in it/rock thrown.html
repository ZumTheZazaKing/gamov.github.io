            You pick up the nearest rock from the ground and you throw it into the hole. You<br>
            wait for the sound of that rock landing but you don't hear it land at all after a<br>
            few seconds. It seems that the hole is very deep. <strong>Jumping into it</strong> should be<br>
            out of the question.
