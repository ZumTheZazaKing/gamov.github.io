            Your eyes open as if you haven't done so in ages. You take a deep breath and sit up.<br>
            'Where am I? Why am I here?' you wonder as you look around the area desperately,<br>
            only to find yourself lost in what seems to be a dark and gloomy forest. After some time<br>
            of panicking, you finally decide to settle down and you stand up on your feet. It's time,<br>
            to make your <strong>first</strong> move.
