            You steady your breath and puff up your chest as you decide to duel the big and<br> 
            hairy beast. It didn't take long for you to realize that you didn't have a weapon<br>
            to fight with. Fortunately, there are three items nearby on the ground that could be<br>
            of use to you. Those three items were a stick, a bottle with black-colored powder,<br> 
            and a gun. However, you only have time to pick up one of those items.
