            Without hesitation, you leap towards the bottle and pick it up from the ground. The bear<br>
            responds by charging at you with full speed. You don't really know what you can accomplish with<br>
            the bottle. However, you start to recognize what the powder in the bottle is. It was gunpowder.<br>
            Knowing how gunpowder works, you threw the bottle at the vicious bear and it exploded upon<br>
            impact.<br>
            <br>
            <em>BOOM!</em><br>
            <br>
            The forest was shaken and your entire body was engulfed in smokes of carbon. After some time,<br>
            the smoke was cleared and you could see the remains of the bear you once fought lying on the<br>
            ground, burnt to a crisp. As things couldn't get any better, it did.<br>
            <br>
            <em>Whirr...</em><br>
            <br>
            It was the sound of a helicopter. The pilot must have been drawn to the loud explosion and pillar of smoke<br>
            you made. As soon as the helicopter came into sight, you wave at it. The pilot could see you and he hovered the<br>
            helicopter above your location. With one simple push of a button, the pilot brought down a very long<br>
            rope, which you will then use to climb on to the helicopter and get a ride with the pilot.
