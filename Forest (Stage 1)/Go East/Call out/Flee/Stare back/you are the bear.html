            Your eyes open and you find yourself in a dark place. 'What is this place?' you wonder.<br>
            You notice that something was very off with yourself. You feel like as if your body<br>
            got heavier and you feel really itchy on every spot of your body. There seems to be a<br>
            light that'll lead you to the exit of the dark place, so you follow it. Upon reaching<br>
            the light, you enter the forest that you were once in a few hours ago.<br><br>

            You're not dead. The bear didn't kill you. You wonder 'Why?'<br><br>

            You turn around and you realize that you had just come out from the cave you found<br>
            the bear in. You're confused. 'Why did the bear save me?', you wonder. All of your<br>
            questions were answered when you took a quick look at your arm. You're shocked and<br>
            bewildered. Your arm was not that of a human but a...bear's. You look at your feet,<br>
            they were also that of a bear's. You look at your body, they were also that of a bear's<br>
            <br>
            After inspecting yourself for three minutes, you came to a conclusion.<br>
            You have become the bear.
