            You decide to give the bear a taste of his own medicine and you stare straight back at him.<br>
            For some reason, you start feeling dizzy but you keep on pinning the bear down in your center <br>
            of vision. Eventually, you start feeling sleepy and all that you could think of was the bear. You<br>
            couldn't get the thought of that bear out of your head and so you slap yourself multiple times.<br><br>
            'None, Protect, None', those were the only things you could think of. You got very tired but<br>
            you continue to stare back at the creature. You knew that something wasn't right about the bear.<br>
            The bear had multiple patterns on its front and back. 'What could those patterns mean?', you<br>
            wonder. However, it's futile to wonder any longer as the branch you sat on broke.<br><br>
            You fall down to the ground...and the last thing you saw was the hairy beast <br>approaching your way.
