            You immediately turn tail and run for your very life. The bear responds by following you<br>
            from behind. You turn around as you sprinted and you could see the intent to kill in the<br>
            carnivore's eyes. Now that you think about, you didn't know where you were going and you<br>
            don't even know where to go. Eventually, you figure out that you won't be able to keep on<br>
            running any time soon. As an act of desperation to escape, you climb a tree and sit on<br>
            top one of its branches. The bear tries to follow but it couldn't climb no matter what. <br>
            In the end, the bear just stares you down at the bottom of the tree,<br>
            waiting for the moment to strike.
