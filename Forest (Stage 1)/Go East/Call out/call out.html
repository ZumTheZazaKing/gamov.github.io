            You call out to the cave at the top of your voice while holding your hands<br>
            by your mouth. You keep on doing so multiple times with the hope of drawing<br>
            the attention of whatever might be inside the cave. After a while, you take deep<br>
            breaths and come to the conclusion that there's nothing in the cave. Just as you<br>
            thought it was safe, something emerged from within the cave's shadows.<br>
            It was a bear, and the bear did not seem to be happy with your presence.
