            You decide to go East, thinking it was a wise choice. After a few minutes, you stumble<br>
            upon what seems to be a dark and dreary cave. The cave entrance was covered in bits of<br>
            green moist moss and there was a wooden crooked sign right next to it<br>
            which clearly stated,<br>
            "<strong>DO NOT ENTER</strong>".
