            You gather up bravado before entering the silent and jet black cave. Upon entering,<br>
            you could see nothing, including the fingers on your hands. You keep moving forward until<br>
            eventually, you bump into something. That 'something' felt quite soft and furry<br>
            but knowing that the 'something' had such characteristics was frightening. It was obvious<br>
            that the 'something' was a living creature and it seems to have accomodated this cave as a place<br>
            for sleep. You want to go back but you have already gone this far. Don't you want to<br>
            explore more? <br>
            <br>
            Of course, you do. So...
