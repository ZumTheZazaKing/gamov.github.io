            You nod your head to confirm his statement. After doing so, the man takes a big long sigh.<br>

            "Alright, then. Listen up. I'm a part of the AAA. I was sent here to see something really <br>
            dangerous. Everything was running real smooth, until I met you. So, I'll give you two options, kid. <br>
            One, you leave this cave and you wait for me inside my helicopter which is parked right outside. <br>
            Two, you follow me to where I'm going but it's not my problem if you die.<br>
