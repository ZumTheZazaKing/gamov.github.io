            You go up to a wall that has a weird looking text on it. The text seems to be either<br>
            written in some ancient unknown forgotten language or written with awful handwriting.<br>
            Either way, you manage to make it out and this is what it says:<br>
            <br>
            "What lies within this chamber is a weapon capable of eradicating the existence of<br>
            the entire universe. It is called 'TEFA'. TEFA is protected by a creature named 'The Guardian' whose<br>
            appearance is similar to that of a bear. The Guardian is a human mutated for untold<br>
            purposes. The Guardian is able to transfer the role of The Guardian to a harmless human<br>
            and once it does it shall fade out of existence and the said human will become The Next<br>
            Guardian."<br>
            <br>
            "If The Guardian was to ever be killed, then may those who kill it be punished or rewarded <br>
            as only those who are worthy of its power can use TEFA. Those who are not will meet an 
            <br>undesired fate."
