            You pull back the stick away from the surface of the creature and with all your might,<br>
            you push it back instantaneously. It was a direct hit, but what you just did isn't something<br>
            that people would call poking. You did a full-on stab attempt, with a stick. Anyway, what<br>
            matters most is the result. Was there a reaction? Yes, there was. The creature made a absurd<br>
            sound before turning around to look at you. Even though you couldn't see its face, you<br>
            could very much see its glowing eyes and that was already enough to scare the crap<br>
            out of you.
