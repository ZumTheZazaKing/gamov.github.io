            "Anthony, wait!", you yelled as you quickly try to grab Anthony's arm.<br>
            As you near him...<br>
            <br>
            <em>BANG!</em><br>
            <br>
            "Move any closer and I'll go for the head", Anthony warned after shooting your arm.<br>
            <br>
            You need to stop him. You must. But the pain...it was excruciating. Blood spilt<br>
            down like a bloody waterfall right next to your legs. It didn't take long for you<br>
            to realize that your shot arm  was on the verge of tearing apart from your body.<br>
            <br>
            As you finally place your attention back onto Anthony, it was already too late. Anthony,<br>
            who had already pulled the item out from the wall, had his rifle pointed directly at<br>
            you.<br>
            <br>
            "Now that I think about it, I don't really need you. You can just go and die",<br>
            Anthony stated as he was about to pull the trigger.<br>
            <br>
            Just then, Anthony was suddenly engulfed in flames and his entire body was burnt with<br>
            absolutely nothing left behind.
