            You didn't understand what just happened but you were thankful it happened. Just as things subsided,<br>
            pain reminds you about your broken arm. You could feel yourself getting dizzy, probably due to blood<br>
            loss. Eventually, you fall down to the ground on your stomach. You don't know what to do. You're pretty sure<br>
            that you're going to die the more anemic you get. However, you could feel something calling for you.<br>
            <br>
            You look up and you see that the mysterious spherical item Anthony was holding is now on the ground.<br>
            For some reason, a pale white light is flickering within it. You know that the item is calling you.<br>
            You crawl up to it with all the viguor you had left in your body. At last, you got up to it and all<br>
            you have to do now is touch it.
