            "I would like to go with number two", you reply.<br>
            <br>
            "For real? You're serious, aren't you? Oh well, it can't be helped. You've got guts, kid.<br>
            I'll give you that. Now come on. Let's go. Don't slow me down and don't get in my way.<br>
            By the way, the name's Anthony."<br>
            <br>
            Anthony walks deeper into the cave as you follow him from behind. Eventually, the two of<br>
            you reach the end of the cave and there, a massive door with a strange symbol on it awaits.<br>
            <br>
            "What is this?", you asked with eyes of astonishment.<br>
            <br>

            As Anthony tries to pry open the mysterious door, a strange ambient light coming from <br>
            the mysterious door acted as a light source and causes you to discover several interesting<br> 
            things around the area. You start to get bored, so maybe you should play around for a bit.
