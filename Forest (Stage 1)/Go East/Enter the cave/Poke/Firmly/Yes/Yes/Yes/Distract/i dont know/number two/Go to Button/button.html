            It can hardly be seen but there was a button on one of the cave's walls and it was really<br>
            close to the floor. You go up to it and due to curiosity, you press the button. A few <br>
            seconds after the button was pressed, the mysterious door opened up.<br>
            <br>
            "Hey, kid! I got the door open. Come on, hurry up", Anthony called out.<br>
            <br>
            It wasn't cool for him to take the credit but it didn't bother you. Pass the doors, you and<br>
            Anthony enter a room that was brightened by ambient blue light which source is unknown.<br>
            Opposite of where you and Anthony are is a black spherical item burrowed into the wall.<br>
            <br>
            "There it is. I must retrieve it. You stay there and don't move an inch, kid", Anthony advised<br>
            as he slowly approached the item with his fingers wriggling like worms.<br>
            <br>
            You have a bad feeling about this.
