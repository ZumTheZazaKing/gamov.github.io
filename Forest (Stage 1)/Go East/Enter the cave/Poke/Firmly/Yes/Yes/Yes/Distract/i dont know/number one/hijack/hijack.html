            'Screw that man!', you thought as you inserted the helicopter's key into its keyhole.<br>
            Without a moment to waste, you start up the engine and the blades on top begin to rotate.<br>
            After a few seconds of rotation, the helicopter had enough force to push itself into the sky.<br>
            All that you could see was the endless horizon as you seated yourself upon the pilot's seat.<br>
            You made your esape from the forest with a helicopter which is great and you also ditched a man<br>
            which is also great...I guess.<br>
            <br>
            Without looking back, you fly further away into the distance...
