            You take deep breaths as you restrain yourself from showing signs of fear and hostility.<br>
            Once you got your behaviour under control, you start grooving. You decided to do this<br>
            thinking that you could confuse the creature with your strange, unpredicting movements.<br>
            It seems to be working. However, just as you took a step backward...<br>
            <br>
            <em>BANG!</em><br>
            <br>
            It was the sound of a gunshot. You turn to where the sound was emitted and there<br>
            stood a man holding a rifle while wearing a helmet with a flashlight. It seems<br>
            that the man had shot the creature down and it seems to be dead as you could no<br>
            longer feel its belligerent presence.<br>
            <br>
            The man asks, "What are you doing here?"
