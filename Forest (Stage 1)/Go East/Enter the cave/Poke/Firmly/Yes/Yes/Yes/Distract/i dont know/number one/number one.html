            "I would like to go with number one", you reply.<br>
            <br>
            "Heh, wise choice. Welp, here you go. Be sure to not lose them", the man simpered as he<br>
            threw what seem to be the helicopter keys at you. As you manage to catch the flying keys,<br>
            the man says one more thing,<br>
            <br>
            "By the way, the name's Anthony"<br>
            <br>
            'Anthony? That's a nice name', you thought as you run to the exit of the cave. Upon making<br>
            direct contact with the shine of the golden medallion once again, you saw a helicopter<br>
            nearby. 'That must be Anthony's helicopter' you thought as you approached it slowly.<br>
            Using the keys entrusted to you, you unlock the doors and enter the helicopter.<br>
            <br>
            Anthony specifically told you to wait for him inside the helicopter, but a part of<br>
            you has a different idea which he probably wouldn't like.
