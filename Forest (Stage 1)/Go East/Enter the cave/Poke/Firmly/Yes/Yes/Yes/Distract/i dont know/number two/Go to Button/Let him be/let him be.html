            You stand and watch as Anthony gets ever closer to the anonymous item. It didn't take long<br>
            for him to finally reach it. Without even blinking, Anthony quickly grabbed onto the item<br>
            and pulled it out from the wall.<br>
            <br>
            "Okay, kid. Mission completed. Let's go", Anthony smiled as he sauntered towards you.<br>
            <br>
            Out of the blue, he fell down to the ground and he dropped the ball-like item upon doing so.<br>
            <br>
            "Kid! Help me! I forgot that only those who are worthy can wield it! Kid...Hel-"<br>
            <br>
            Before he could even finish his sentence, Anthony's entire body was suddenly engulfed in<br>
            flames. In an instant, Anthony's entire body was burnt from head to toe, leaving absolutely<br>
            nothing behind, not even dust.<br>
            <br>
            For some reason, you don't feel anything about his death. Oh well...<br>
            What matters now is the mysterious item that's now on the floor. Before Anthony died, you<br>
            remember that he said only those who are worthy can wield it. 'Am I worthy?', you wonder.<br>
            Who knows? You will never know unless you give it a try.
