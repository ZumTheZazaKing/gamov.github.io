            Without even taking a moment to focus, you turn tail and run away as fast as you can.<br>
            You dash to the exit of the cave. However, there was one obstacle. A rock. A very small<br>
            rock. That shouldn't be any trouble...right? Wrong. It was completely dark, so you couldn't see<br>
            a damn thing, including the rock. As expected, you trip over that rock and when you tried<br>
            to get back up, your body splits...<br>
