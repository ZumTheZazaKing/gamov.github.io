            "Nothing you need to know about", you reply while turning your back on the man.<br>
            <br>
            Was what you said proper? Is that how you should talk to someone you just met?<br>
            Of course not. It was pretty bold of you to make sucha move. Oh well...<br>
            You can't take back what has already been done. You now await for the man's<br>
            response...<br>

            You drop to the ground. You were shot but you don't know where. You didn't<br>

            you were innocent."<br>
            <br>
            You close your eyes...
