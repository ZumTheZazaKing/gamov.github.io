            You go up to a wall that has a weird looking text on it. The text seems to be either<br>
            written in some ancient unknown forgotten language or written with awful handwriting.<br>
            Either way, you manage to make it out and this is what it says:<br>
            <br>
            "TEFA. That is the name of the weapon that resides beyond the pristine obsidian<br>
            doors. Only those who are worthy shall wield its power. What can TEFA do?<br>
            It can manipulate the constructer that builds this very universe. That constructor<br>
            is called the Truth. Those who wield TEFA become absolute and none shall<br>
            surpass their strength."<br>
            <br>
            "Apparently, more than one TEFA exists in this world. In fact, there are two TEFAs<br>
            which currently exists. The first TEFA is a non-living object in the form of a<br>
            black sphere. That TEFA is the one that is kept beyond these doors. The second<br>
            TEFA is a living organism that looks, thinks, acts and lives the same as a human.<br>
            If the two TEFA's were to make contact with one another, then the world would be<br>
            in great disarray"
