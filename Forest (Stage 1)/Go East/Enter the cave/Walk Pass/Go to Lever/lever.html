            On the floor of the cave near one of the cave's walls, lies a lever. Out of curiosity,<br>
            you pull the lever and upon doing so, the mysterious doors open up. You decide to <br>
            go through the doors as that was the only thing you could do and you enter a room<br>
            that was brightened by ambient blue light which source is unknown.<br> 
            <br>
            Opposite of where you are standing is a black spherical item burrowed into the wall.<br>
            You wonder what it is so you decide to approach it. Suddenly...<br>
            <br>
            <em>BANG!</em><br>
            <br>
            You drop on one knee as you could feel your left leg getting weaker by the second.<br>
            Blood spilt on the ground next to your weak leg so you conclude that someone has<br>
            shot you in the leg.<br>
            <br>
            "Don't move and answer my questions! <strong>Why are you here?</strong>", the voice<br>
            of a man questioned from behind.
