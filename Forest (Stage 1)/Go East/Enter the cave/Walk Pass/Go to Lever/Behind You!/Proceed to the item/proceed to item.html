            You use the chance that the bear has given you to reach the mysterious item.<br>
            As you somehow near it with one leg heavily injured, a pale white light begins<br> 
            to flicker from within the item. Seeing such strange phenomenon has made you want<br>
            to reach the item even more. At last, the item was within your range of reach and<br>
            you draw your hand forward to it. Suddenly...<br>
            <br>
            <em>BANG!</em><br>
            <br>
            Your extended hand was shot and torn apart from your arm. At this rate, you will<br>
            die from blood loss.<br>
            <br>
            "Don't you dare touch the TEFA!" the man raged as he reloads his rifle to shoot<br>
            you once more.<br>
            <br>
            It seems that he has taken down the bear. You'll have to be fast for your next move.
