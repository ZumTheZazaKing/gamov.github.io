            "Behind you!", you shouted back.<br>
            <br>
            "Huh?", the man quavered as he turned around instantly.<br>
            <br>
            Hopefully something pops out from behind him and take him down. You look back  <br>
            to see if there was actually something behind him. Luckily, there was. <br>
            A bear emerges from within the shadows of the cave and it charges <br>
            at the man with full speed.<br>
            <br>
            "I thought I killed you!", the man proclaims as he reloads his rifle in a<br>
            rushed manner.<br>
            <br>
            This is your chance to make your move!
