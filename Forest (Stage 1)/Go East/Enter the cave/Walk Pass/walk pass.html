            You simply decide to ignore the unknown creature and walk pass it. By doing so, you go even<br>
            deeper into the cave. After some time, you finally made it to the end of the cave and there, <br>
            a massive door with a strange symbol on it awaits.<br>
            <br>
            You don't know anything about the mysterious door before you. However, you do know that there's<br>
            somehow a strange blue ambient light coming out from it. That blue light is able to serve you as a<br>
            light source and because of it, you're able to find some interesting things nearby the area.<br>
            <br>
            You should check them out.
